# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
The goal of this project is to analyze the **global adoption trends of Electric Vehicles (EVs)**. Using the EV population dataset, I aimed to uncover patterns in distribution by geography, vehicle type, manufacturer, and pricing, while also exploring the relationship between **electric range** and **base MSRP**.  

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- **Python** (Data wrangling & analysis)  
- **Pandas** & **NumPy** â†’ data cleaning & transformation  
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** â†’ data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** â†’ interactive analysis & reporting  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values and standardized categorical data.  
   - Ensured the dataset was ready for exploration and visualization.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of EV types (Battery Electric vs Plug-in Hybrid).  
   - Adoption trends by **country, state, and city**.  
   - Top manufacturers and models contributing to EV growth.  
   - Pricing vs electric range comparison.  

3. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Used bar plots, count plots, and scatter plots to illustrate adoption trends.  
   - Compared concentration of EV adoption across different geographies.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Findings  
- **Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)** dominate the dataset compared to Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).  
- Certain **states and cities** stand out as EV adoption hubs, reflecting local policies and infrastructure.  
- A handful of **manufacturers (top 5)** contribute significantly to EV availability, with a few models leading the adoption curve.  
- A positive but **non-linear relationship** exists between **electric range and base MSRP**â€”higher range EVs generally cost more, but exceptions exist.  
- EV adoption is **geographically concentrated**, with the top 10 cities accounting for a disproportionate share of vehicles.  

## ðŸ“Š Final Report / Conclusion  
The analysis highlights that **EV adoption is accelerating but unevenly distributed** across geographies. While major manufacturers and urban centers dominate the current landscape, the future will likely see wider distribution as costs decrease and infrastructure improves.  

This project demonstrates the use of **Python for data-driven storytelling** and provides a foundation for deeper policy or market-focused EV studies.
